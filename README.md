# IPA-Keyboard-iOS

An iOS keyboard for typing symbols in the International Phonetic Alphabet.

<b>I stopped uploading new code to this repository because of a weird GitHub-Xcode bug. The app will still be updated.</b>

## Purpose

* Most IPA symbols cannot be typed using regular keyboards

* Full Unicode keyboards are too hard to navigate; an IPA-specific keyboard would have demand among linguistics hobbyists

* All IPA Keyboards on the App Store right now are either non-free, full of ads, or poorly designed; this project aims to solve all three problems

* An relatively easily accomplishable project to boost my currently negative self-esteem

## To-Do List (for future releases)

### Separate keyboard extensions

* IPA Extended (extIPA)

* _Obsolete symbols_

* _Nonstandard symbols_

* _Custom keyboard (custom keys and custom order)_

### All keyboard extensions

* (maybe) Recently used keys

* Press and hold on backspace/delete button to rapidly delete

### Host app

* Link to the Wikipedia IPA page in app

* Link to Bug Report / Feedback in app
