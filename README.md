# IPA-Keyboard-iOS

**[NEW]** 1.0.1 Beta Testing is available: https://testflight.apple.com/join/lPas1HHg 

An iOS keyboard for typing symbols in the International Phonetic Alphabet. 

Download on the App Store: https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ipa-phonetic-keyboard/id1440241497

## Purpose

* Most IPA symbols cannot be typed using regular keyboards

* Full Unicode keyboards are too hard to navigate; an IPA-specific keyboard would have demand among linguistics hobbyists

* All IPA Keyboards on the App Store right now are either non-free, full of ads, or poorly designed; this project aims to solve all three problems

* A relatively easily accomplishable project to boost my currently negative self-esteem

## To-Do List: Changes to be made for next release

- [x] Keyboard show/hide in the host app

- [x] Add ɝ in the main IPA keyboard

- [x] Add ◌ (dotted circle), in both the top bar of the main IPA keyboard (alongside "\[\]", "//", and "~") and as a display element on keys for diacritics

## To-Do List: Current Bugs

- [ ] If the user switched to this keyboard before using WeChat Pay, this keyboard replaces the system numerical keyboard, rendering the user unable to enter numbers for WeChat Pay's numerical field

  * **fix** - tell the system that this keyboard cannot be used as a numerical keyboard
