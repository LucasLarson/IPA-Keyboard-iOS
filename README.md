# IPA-Keyboard-iOS

An iOS keyboard for typing symbols in the International Phonetic Alphabet. 

## Purpose

* Most IPA symbols cannot be typed using regular keyboards

* Full Unicode keyboards are too hard to navigate; an IPA-specific keyboard would have demand among linguistics hobbyists

* All IPA Keyboards on the App Store right now are either non-free, full of ads, or poorly designed; this project aims to solve all three problems

* An relatively easily accomplishable project to boost my currently negative self-esteem
